# EasyCrosshair_V1.1
I made this Crosshair tool, because I didn't want to pay 5$ on the steam market for Crosshair X. The purpose of the tool is to project a simple cross, circle or a + in the midde of the screen. It will be displayed as the most top Layer. Usefull for Games you get a little advantage.  

Following Issues I want to fix in the future:
1. F8 toggle doesnt work. They Key F8 should hide the menu
   after clicking F8 again it should be visible. (doesnt work)
2. Minimize Button is buggy sometimes the program just closes
   and other times it looks like its closed, but u need to close it
   in the task manager.
3. The menu looks kinda ugly,because of the bad options that python gives me,
   learning C# right now to do it better.
