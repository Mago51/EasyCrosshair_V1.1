# EasyCrosshair_V2.0
I released now Version 2.0 of my Crosshair Tool. First I thought it would be a easy beginner
code which I could finish with maximum 250 line of Code and save 5€ by not buying "Crosshair X"
on steam market and doing it myself. Version 2.0 has now 750 lines of Code everything done
with Python it felt like a war against my brain.

The newest version fixxed following problems of Version 1.1:
1.) The menu does looks more modern 
2.) F8 Toggle Crosshair works now perfectly (+ added a extra bind for F9)
3.) Minmize Button is not buggy anymore and it works
4.) I added a tray icon with hide/show button
5.) More options for Crosshair customizations
6.) HUD Frame for Live FPS/CPU/RAM usage Screen in the right top corner
7.) Donation Frame to gain something
8.) Themes button to change the Colors of the Menu.

It works perfectly now beside the FPS/CPU/RAM Screen it is sometimes buggy.
I will fix it soon.

Have fun with it
