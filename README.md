# EasyCrosshair_V2.0
I released now Version 2.0 of my Crosshair Tool. First I thought it would be a easy beginner
code which I could finish with maximum 250 line of Code and save 5€ by not buying "Crosshair X"
on steam market and doing it myself. Version 2.0 has now 750 lines of Code everything done
with Python it felt like a war against my brain.

The newest version fixxed following problems of Version 1.1:
The menu does looks more modern 
F8 Toggle Crosshair works now perfectly (+ added a extra bind for F9)
Minmize Button is not buggy anymore and it works
I added a tray icon with hide/show button
More options for Crosshair customizations
HUD Frame for Live FPS/CPU/RAM usage Screen in the right top corner
Donation Frame to gain something
Themes button to change the Colors of the Menu.

It works perfectly now beside the FPS/CPU/RAM Screen it is sometimes buggy.
I will fix it soon.

Have fun with it
